## ðŸ•’ Issue SLA Policy

We aim to respond and resolve issues in a timely manner based on their priority:

| Priority       | First Response SLA | Resolution SLA  |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| ðŸŸ¥ Critical     | within 2 hours      | within 24 hours |
| ðŸŸ§ High         | within 8 hours      | within 48 hours |
| ðŸŸ¨ Medium       | within 24 hours     | within 5 days   |
| ðŸŸ© Low          | within 48 hours     | within 7 days   |

- **"First response"** means someone from the team will acknowledge the issue.
- **"Resolution"** means the issue is resolved or a fix is planned and communicated.

SLA timers start from the time the issue is opened.
